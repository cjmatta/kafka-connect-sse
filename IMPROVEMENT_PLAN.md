# Kafka Connect SSE Source Connector - Improvement Plan

This document outlines a systematic approach to improving the Kafka Connect SSE Source Connector project. Each step represents a small, atomic change that addresses a specific concern, with subsequent steps building upon previous improvements.

## Core Issues to Address

- **Connector Stability**: The connector sometimes hangs and doesn't send data
- **Logging Quality**: Insufficient logging makes it difficult to diagnose issues
- **Code Documentation**: Limited comments affect maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Improved error detection and recovery is needed
- **Configuration Options**: Missing useful configuration options for timeouts, reconnection, etc.

## Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Diagnostics & Observability

#### Step 1: Enhanced Logging in ServerSentEventClient
- Add connection state tracking with detailed logging
- Implement log levels appropriately (trace, debug, info, warn, error)
- Include timestamps and better context in log messages

#### Step 2: Connection Health Monitoring
- Add health check mechanism to detect "zombie" connections
- Implement an idle timeout to detect when no events are flowing
- Add periodic connection state logging for long-running connections

#### Step 3: Error Handling Improvements
- Enhance error detection capabilities
- Implement more robust error recovery logic
- Add detailed error logging with contextual information

#### Step 4: Metrics Collection
- Add basic metrics tracking for events, connection status, etc.
- Implement JMX metrics for Kafka Connect monitoring integration
- Create a health/status reporting mechanism

### Phase 2: Functional Improvements

#### Step 5: Offset Management
- Most SSE servers don't support resuming from an ID, so we're not going to support offset management
- Keep the existing empty maps 

#### Step 6: Connection Configuration
- Add timeout configuration options
- Implement configurable reconnection strategy
- Add support for HTTP headers and parameters

#### Step 7: Event Filtering
- Add support for filtering events by type/name
- Implement configurable event transformation
- Support for pattern-based filtering

#### Step 8: Performance Enhancements
- Optimize queue management
- Improve threading model
- Add batch size configuration

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

#### Step 9: Security Enhancements
- Add OAuth support
- Implement advanced TLS/SSL configuration
- Add proxy support

#### Step 10: Content Processing
- Support for different content types (JSON, XML, etc.)
- Add schema evolution support
- Implement content transformation options

#### Step 11: Circuit Breaker Implementation
- Add failure threshold detection
- Implement backoff strategies
- Add alerting capability

## Development Approach

For each step in this plan:

1. Start by focusing on one component at a time
2. Write tests first to validate the current behavior and expected changes
3. Make incremental changes with clear before/after states
4. Update documentation to reflect new capabilities
5. Validate functionality after each change

## Execution Guidelines

- Work on one file at a time to avoid corruption
- Run tests after each change to ensure functionality is maintained
- Update the README.md with new configuration options as they're added
- Follow the existing code style for consistency
